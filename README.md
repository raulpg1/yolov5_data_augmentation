# Study of the quality of detections in the YOLOv5 network using data augmentation techniques.

The aim of this end-of-degree final project is to study the efficiency of the object detection network in images and videos, YOLOv5, when using data augmentation techniques. For this purpose, the mAP (mean Average Precision) meter will be use.
Transformations have been used to apply data augmentation. These transformations are changes in color, brightness, contrast, saturation, or rotations of the image. Moreover, they can be combined with each other to generate new transformations.
A study will be conducted to get which of the applied transformations has improved the value of the mAP meter the most in respect of the value of the mAP meter of the original images set.
